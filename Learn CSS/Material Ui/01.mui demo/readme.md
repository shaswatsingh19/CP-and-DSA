# Learning Material UI

### Installation 

Create React app for working with react

- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

- npm install @mui/icons-material

- add link for default google font


### Usage 

- Material UI components work in isolation. They are self-supporting, and will only inject the styles they need to display
